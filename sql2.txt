1. Retrieve the ProductName and TotalCount for all orders for a product.  Here you will need
to join the OrderDetails table with the product table.  For TotalCount, you will Use
SUM(Quantity) AS TotalCount .  Order by product name.
You will need to group by product ID.  Paste your SQL statement below.

SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalCount FROM OrderDetails od JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName ORDER BY p.ProductName;


2. Retrieve the customer name and OrderDetails ID for all the OrderDetails for each customer,
ordered by customer name. Paste your SQL statement below. You will have to join the Customers
table with the Orders table, and the Orders table with the OrderDetails table, 
because the Orders table is the one that ties the Customer table to the OrderDetails table.

SELECT c.CustomerName, od.OrderDetailID FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID ORDER BY c.CustomerName;

3. Extend the previous query to join the Products table.  You are now joining the Customers, Orders,
OrderDetails, and Products tables.  The result of your query should include the
customer name, the product name, and the total quantity of that product ordered.  Note that a customer
may have ordered the same product in several different orders.  So the total quantity is
SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity and you must GROUP BY CustomerID, ProductID.  Paste your
SQL statement below.

SELECT c.CustomerName, p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID GROUP BY c.CustomerName, p.ProductName ORDER BY c.CustomerName;

4. Extend the previous query to give the total price as well as the customer name, product name, 
and total quantity.  Here you will have
(SUM(Quantity) * Price) AS TotalPrice.  Paste your SQL statement below.

SELECT c.CustomerName, p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity, (SUM(od.Quantity) * p.Price) AS TotalPrice FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID GROUP BY c.CustomerName, p.ProductName, p.Price ORDER BY c.CustomerName;

5. Add a new Order to the Orders table.  You will have to specify the ID of an existing customer
to satisfy the foreign key constraint.  You will also have to specify the ID of an existing
employee.  Paste your SQL statement below.

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, ShipperID) VALUES (10447, 90, 10, '2024-06-26', 3);

6. Add three OrderDetails.  These should specify the ID of the new Order you just created.  For each,
you will have to specify the ID of an existing product.  Paste your SQL statement below.

INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES (519, 10447, 1, 30);
INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES (520, 10447, 2, 20);
INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES (521, 10447, 3, 10);

7.  Delete the third of the OrderDetails you just added.  Paste your SQL statement below.

DELETE FROM OrderDetails WHERE OrderDetailID = 521;

8. Update the Price Table, so that every product with a price less than $20 has the price increased by
0.50.  Paste your SQL statement below.

UPDATE Products SET Price = Price + 0.50 WHERE Price < 20;

9.  Try to delete Customer 76.  What happens? What would you have to delete in order to delete
this customer?  (Hint: It's not just orders.)   There are three statements to be performed, in order
to delete this customer.  The first is

DELETE FROM OrderDetails WHERE OrderID IN (SELECT OrderID FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID=76);

What are the other two statements?  Try them out, and then paste them below.

DELETE FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 76;

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 76;

You continue to work in the sqlintro repository for Assignment 2. Create a new branch, called lesson2.  This should be done when the lesson1 branch is active, so that you are adding to last week's work.  The lesson2 branch is the one you will use for this week's work.

In this repository, there is a file sql2.txt.  It directs you to compose various SQL statements.  Compose the SQL statements and try them out against the database using the sqlcommand program.   Once you have them
working, paste them in as answers into sql2.txt.

## Submitting Your Work

Add, commit, and push your changes for the lesson2 branch.  Then create the pull request as before.  Then submit a link to the pull request with your homework submission.
